# BUS_Classification
1. Download Dataset and models from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cr_AjI7Zlc7NEl7edCQy-y74cr8r-R9I?usp=sharing

2. early.py is used for early stopping

3. Train the model by running train_classification_B_SE.py file


4. Test the performance of Alexnet and ResNet model using test_classification_B_SE.py


5. Train the classification layer only using train_classification_B_SE_Ensemble.py by ensembling AlexNet and ResNet models

6. Final models are stored in Model folder

7. Test the final model using test_classification_B_SE_Ensemble.py
