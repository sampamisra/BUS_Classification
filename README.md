# BUS_Classification
Train the model by running train_classification_CV_Both_github.py file
For ResNet 5 models will be genrated..For AlexNet 5 models will be genrated
Test the performance of Alexnet and ResNet model using test_classification_Both_github.py
Train the classification layer only using train_classification_CV_Both_Ensemble_Github.py by ensembling AlexNet and ResNet models
Test the final model using test_classification_Both_Ensemble_Github.py
Final models are stored in Models folder
