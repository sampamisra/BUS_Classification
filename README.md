# BUS_Classification
1. Train the model by running train_classification_CV_Both_github.py file


2. For ResNet 5 models will be genrated..For AlexNet 5 models will be genrated


3. Test the performance of Alexnet and ResNet model using test_classification_Both_github.py


4. Train the classification layer only using train_classification_CV_Both_Ensemble_Github.py by ensembling AlexNet and ResNet models


5. Test the final model using test_classification_Both_Ensemble_Github.py

6. Final models are stored in Model folder
