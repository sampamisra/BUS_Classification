# BUS_Classification
1. Train the model by running train_classification_CV_Both_github.py file


2. Test the performance of Alexnet and ResNet model using test_classification_Both_github.py


3. Train the classification layer only using train_classification_CV_Both_Ensemble_Github.py by ensembling AlexNet and ResNet models

4. Final models are stored in Model folder

5. Test the final model using test_classification_Both_Ensemble_Github.py
