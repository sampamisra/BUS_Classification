# BUS_Classification
1. early.py is used for early stopping

2. Train the model by running train_classification_B_SE.py file


3. Test the performance of Alexnet and ResNet model using test_classification_B_SE.py


4. Train the classification layer only using train_classification_B_SE_Ensemble.py by ensembling AlexNet and ResNet models

5. Final models are stored in Model folder

6. Test the final model using test_classification_B_SE_Ensemble.py


crop_and_erase.m is used for cropping B-mode and Strain images from the original images in such a way that they are co-aligned.
