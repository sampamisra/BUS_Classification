# BUS_Classification
1. Train the model by running train_classification_CV_B_SE.py file


2. Test the performance of Alexnet and ResNet model using test_classification_B_SE.py


3. Train the classification layer only using train_classification_CV_B_SE_Ensemble.py by ensembling AlexNet and ResNet models

4. Final models are stored in Model folder

5. Test the final model using test_classification_B_SE_Ensemble.py

6. early.py is used for early stopping

7. Dataset and models can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cr_AjI7Zlc7NEl7edCQy-y74cr8r-R9I?usp=sharing
